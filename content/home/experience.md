        1. Collaboratively researched on Thermal Analysis of Many-core Chips with Integrated Photonics:
          * Analyzed thermal behaviors of 2.5D integrated systems and generalized homogeneous systems using HotSpot
          * Brought improvements on simulation efficiency by integrating a Python Wrapper into the generalized thermal simulation framework
          * Researched further on the simulation framework limitations and increased its compatibility to support other thermal simulation methods
        
        2. Collaboratively researched on Thermal Analysis of CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Systems with Integrated Photonics:
          * Designed multiple layers of floor plans using HotSpot thermal simulation platform
          * Analyzed 3 GPU simulators and simulated 6 kinds of GPUs for integration purpose
          * Characterized the heating power requirements for general CPU-GPU systems
